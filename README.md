**Aims**

Contemporary climate change and biological invasions are two main drivers of biodiversity redistribution. Interactive effects between these drivers have been reported in a variety of studies, yet results are conflicting. Some studies find that contemporary climate change facilitates the spread and success of non-native species, especially those with broad physiological tolerances. Other studies conclude that non-natives are vulnerable to current and future changes in climatic conditions. Given that most studies have focused on terrestrial species, here we contribute to this debate by analysing responses of marine native and non-native fauna and flora to key climate-related stressors, namely increased temperature (warming) and decreased salinity (freshening).

**Location:** 

Global

**Time-period:** 

2002–2019

**Major taxa studied:** 

Marine benthic macrophytes and invertebrates

**Methods**

I conducted a meta-analysis of experiments investigating the performance (e.g. growth, survival and reproduction) of benthic species in response to warming and freshening.
I used the ISI Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) to search the peer-reviewed published literature for papers using the following search terms: (‘climate change’ OR ‘global warming’ OR ‘ocean warming’) AND (experiment* OR manipul*) AND (temperature* OR thermal OR salin* OR freshen*) AND (marine OR coastal OR sea OR ocean), with no restriction on publication year. Additional literature was identified by ‘snowballing’ (i.e. searching for references within retrieved articles and reviews). I chose papers that measured biological responses of native and/or non-native species to experimentally controlled changes in temperature (warming) and reduced salinity (freshening). I included papers that measured any biological processes that relate to changes in biological rates (i.e. metabolism and respiration), health or performance (i.e. growth, survival, reproduction) at either the individual organism or population levels. I restricted the search to studies of sessile or sedentary marine and brackish organisms that inhabit depths of up to 10 m, and thus included species typical of shallow seas that are subjected to variation in abiotic stressors. Papers were included if they focused on laboratory or field-based manipulative experiments, either in separate experimental units or together in a community mixture, and measured biological processes among replicated control (ambient) and treatment groups subjected to elevated temperature and/or decreases in salinity. Studies were excluded if experiments did not include replicates or did not provide measures of variation. Multi-driver experiments that explored other variables (e.g. hypoxia or nutrients) for which the independent effects of temperature and freshening could not be measured were excluded.

All studies were coded according to the following covariates: manipulated stressor (warming or freshening), measured biological process (see details in Table 1), nativeness (native or non-native, identified according to the authors’ descriptions or through the World Register of Introduced Marine Species (Ahyong et al., 2020)), the experimental duration (number of days), type of organism (i.e. plant or animal), life-history stage (i.e. larva, adult or juvenile), and geographical location (absolute latitude). Finally, we calculated the ‘stress exposure’ of each study, the absolute difference between experimental and a control level exposure (in degrees Celsius or practical salinity units). For studies that measured environmental variables other than warming and freshening (such as hypoxia or nutrient variation), data were taken from only the experiments where these variables were considered at ‘ambient’ or ‘control’ levels, as determined or described by the authors. The control conditions of the focal environmental stressors (warming or freshening) needed to represent current ambient seawater at the time of collection and study or based on the authors’ knowledge and understanding of ambient conditions for the study organism(s) and area.



**Results**

We found that non-native species tended to respond positively to elevated temperature, whereas the performance of native species declined. Similarly, decreased salinity negatively affected the biological processes of native species, but non-natives showed neutral or negative overall responses to freshening.

**Main conclusions**

We find evidence that non-native species outperform natives under a wide variety of warming and freshening conditions. The growth and reproduction of non-natives are enhanced by warmer temperatures, and thus ocean warming is expected to facilitate future spread and success of non-native species. Increased freshening along future coastal areas, however, will likely have a negative impact in both native and non-native species and thus is expected to be a driver of significant change in coastal marine ecosystems. Our comprehensive analysis highlighted the need to expand our understanding of climate change effects beyond warming and specifically, studies focusing on salinity changes.
